An image is slid upon by a filter, the filter had nXn weights and 1 bias, the input image can be worked upon by n filters creating n featureunique maps with each working to extract different features from the input image.

so you do the convolution with a kernel, add a bias and then use ReLU for each input patch/receptive field from the image.

Subsampling is done to reduce the resolution fo the feature map which reduces the precision of distinctive features, improving robustness and adaptability to variablility.

subsampling takes a 2 by 2 receptive unit of the feature map, computes it's average (avg. pooling), multiplies it by a trainbale coefficient, adds a bias and uses a sigmoid or non linear function
